**tollbooth** is an API gateway that sits in front of your upstream APIs and charges callers per-request using the [x402](https://x402.org) payment protocol. No API keys, no subscriptions — just instant USDC micropayments.

## Who is this for?

- **API providers** who want to monetize endpoints without building billing infrastructure
- **AI agent developers** who need machine-to-machine payment flows
- **Anyone** who wants to add pay-per-request pricing to an existing API

## Key features
